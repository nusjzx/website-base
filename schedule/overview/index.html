      <p><strong>If you don't like the click-to-see-more style used by this website</strong>, you can use an all-in-one version of the textbook in the <a href="/website-base/book/common/print.html">printable version</a> page and a similar version of admin
        info in the <a href="/website-base/admin/index.html">Admin Page</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>If you don't like the Web version at all</strong>, a partial solution is to use the pdf version (available on IVLE) of the textbook used in the previous semesters. Caution: That file has not been updated since AY1617 and is slightly behind

        <p><strong>What happens during the tutorial</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A tutorial group is handled by two tutors. Each tutor will work with two teams.</li>
          <li>The tutor will direct students to share/discuss evidence of achieving the weekly learning outcomes (LO).</li>
          <li>If some students have met with difficulties while achieving an LO, the tutor can direct those students to get help from those who have achieved the LO. <strong>The number of LOs that can be covered in the tutorial session depends on how well-prepared you are.</strong></li>
          <li>The tutor will observe, and give feedback on, how well you are achieving required LOs.</li>
          <li>Please <mark>bring your laptop to tutorials.</mark> You often need it to show evidence of LOs you achieved. At other times, we ask you to work on project related things with your team members, which too may require the laptop.</li>

            <p><strong>We want to move you away from 'hand holding' and make you learn how to solve problems on your own.</strong> This is a vital survival skill in the industry and it needs practice.</p>
            <p>Whether it is a technical problem <span class="dimmed">(e.g. error when using the IDE)</span> or a doubt about a concept <span class="dimmed">(e.g. what is the difference between scripted testing and exploratory testing?)¬†</span> <strong>we the teaching team are happy to work <em>with</em> you when you look for a solution/answer, but we do not do it <em>for</em> you.</strong>              We discourage unconditional direct help from tutors because we want you to learn to help yourself. Yes, we believe in ‚Äòtough love‚Äôüòù.</p>
            <p>The question you should always ask yourself is, 'how do I solve this problem if the lecturer/tutors are not around to help me?'</p>

            <p>Note: This guide is mostly about getting tech help, but it also applies to getting clarifications on module topics too. e.g. what is the difference between¬†<em>refactoring</em>¬†and¬†<em>rewriting</em>?</p>
            <p>What not to do:</p>
            <p>When faced with a technical problem or a doubt about a concept, don'f fire off an email lecturer/tutor immediately after you encounter a problem or a doubt, unless it is something only the lecturer/tutor is supposed to know. Instead, here
              are some things you can do:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Check what is given</strong>:¬†Check if the problem/concept has been discussed in the lectures, text book, or the list of resources given to you. Yes it is easier for you to write an email to the tutor/lecturer instead, but that
                  shouldn't be your default behavior. We know that sometimes it is difficult to find stuff in the resources we have provided. But you should try first.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Search</strong>: It is¬†very likely the answer¬†already exists somewhere in the cyberspace. Almost every programming-related question has been answered in places like¬†<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a>. Don't give
                  an opportunity for someone to ask you to <a href="http://www.jibble.org/stfw/">STFW</a>.<br> Pay attention to the error message you encounter. Sometimes it also contains hints as to how to fix the problem. Even if not, a¬†web search on
                  the error message is a good starting point. ¬†<br>

                  similar problems too. If you are really shy to ask questions in the forum, you may use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1vf2TjVhASq_u1_kQEEyURE5fTeBg6iKwGQDJUxYiAmg/viewform">this form</a> to submit your question anonymously

                  <p><em>Rubber duck debugging</em>¬†is an informal term used in software engineering to refer to a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book¬†The Pragmatic Programmer¬†in which a programmer would carry around
                    a rubber duck and debug his code by forcing himself to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.</p>

                <p><strong>Ask the world</strong> using programming forums such as stackoverflow.</p>
                <p>Here are some tips for posting help request:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>PLEASE¬†search for existing answers¬†before you post your question in those public forums; You don't want to appear as a 'clueless' or 'too lazy to do your research' person in a public forum.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Learn to¬†isolate the problem. &quot;My code doesn't work&quot; isn't going to help even if you post the whole code online. Others don't have time to go through all of your code. Isolate the part that doesn't work and strip it down
                      to the bare minimum that is enough reproduce the error. Sometimes, this process actually helps you to figure out the problem yourself. If not, at least it increases the chance of someone else being able to help you.</p>
                    <tip-box>
                      <p>üí° How to isolate problematic code? Delete code (one bit at a time) that is confirmed as not related to the problem. Do that until you can still reproduce the problem with the least amount of code remaining.</p>
                    </tip-box>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Generalize the problem. &quot;How to write tasks to a text file using Java&quot; is too specific to what you are working on. You are more likely to find help if you post a thread called (or search for) &quot;How to write to a file
                      using Java&quot;.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Explain well. Conversations via online forums take time. If you post everything that is relevant to your problem, your chances of getting an answer in the first try is higher. If others have to ask you more questions before they can
                      help you, it will take longer. But this doesn't mean you dump too much information into the thread either.</p>

          <li><strong>No ‚Äòteaching‚Äô</strong>: Tutors are prohibited from ‚Äúteaching‚Äù concepts that are covered in lectures or other learning resources given to you. Self-learning is a vital part of the module. But tutors may help you clarify doubts.</li>

        <panel header="What kind of questions can I ask from tutors?">
          <p>Consider these two questions you might want to ask a tutor:</p>

            <li>‚úÖ <em>This is how I understood/applied coupling. Is that correct?</em> - Such questions are welcome. <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason</strong>:This question shows you have put in some effort to learn the topic and seeking further clarification from the tutor.</span></li>
            <li>üö´ <em>What is coupling?</em> - Such questions will not be entertained. <span class="dimmed"><strong>Reason</strong>: This question implies you haven‚Äôt done what you could to learn the topic in concern.</span></li>
          </ul>
        </panel>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No leading from the front</strong>: Tutors are not expected to lead your project effort. They will not tell you how to do project tasks or when to do project tasks. You have to figure those out yourselves. But tutors will give you feedback
            on how you are doing (or have done) project tasks so that you can improve further.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Timing/venue:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Please refer to the <a href="/website-base/schedule/index.html">Schedule page</a> for further details on each tutorial.</li>
          <li>You are expected to arrive on time. <mark>Punctuality is considered for participation marks.</mark></li>
          <li>You may leave the class 15 minutes before the hour if you have another class right after. There is no need to wait till the tutor dismisses you. However, inform the tutor (as a courtesy) before leaving if you leave before the class is dismissed.</li>
          <li>Please make sure you <mark>vacate the table 5 minutes before the hour</mark> so that the next group can start on time.</li>
          <li>In the past many students have suggested to increase the tutorial duration because 1 hour is barely enough to get through all weekly LOs. Increasing the tutorial time is not possible due to lack of venues and tutors. Instead, let's try to make
            the best of the one hour available by coming well prepared and starting on time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Grading:</strong></p>
        <p>Tutorials are not graded. However, your conduct will be reviewed by team members and the tutor which will determine your participation marks.</p>
